<p>In my free time, I enjoy expressing myself creatively through paintings, photography and video editing.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the art I have created using different mediums. Most of these drawings were done in 2020.</p>

<p>My creative nature facilitates problem solving, allowing me to look at issues from a different perspective. Many artists would agree with the phrase</p>
<div id="a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words" class="section level3">

<p>and throughout my life I realised that it is no different from a statistical point of view.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-when-interpreted-can-tell-a-thousand-stories." class="section level3">

<p>You can look through some of the R projects I have completed by going back to the home page or clicking the top right menu button!</p>
