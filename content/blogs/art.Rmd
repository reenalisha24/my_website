## I Love Art
In my free time, I enjoy expressing myself creatively through paintings, photography and video editing.

Here are some examples of the art I have created using different mediums, most of these drawings were done in 2020. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/art.jpg",error =FALSE)
```

My creative nature facilitates problem solving, allowing me to look at issues from a different perspective. Many would agree with the phrase 

### “a picture is worth a thousand words”

and throughout my life I realised that it is no different from a statistical point of view. 
### Data, when interpreted, can tell a thousand stories.
