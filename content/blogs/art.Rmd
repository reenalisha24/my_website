```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE,
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed

In my free time, I enjoy expressing myself creatively through paintings, photography and video editing.

Here are some examples of the art I have created using different mediums, most of these drawings were done in 2020. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/art.jpg",error =FALSE)
```

My creative nature facilitates problem solving, allowing me to look at issues from a different perspective. Many would agree with the phrase 

### “a picture is worth a thousand words”

and throughout my life I realised that it is no different from a statistical point of view. 

### Data, when interpreted, can tell a thousand stories.
